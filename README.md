MVP description: Our app will allow restaurants to create an inventory with the scope of ingredients and meals. They would be able to upload CSV files to update their inventory and return a report. This will solve the problem of less than accurate monthly manual inventory, and allow the user to get accurate, up to date information about their restaurant inventory.
